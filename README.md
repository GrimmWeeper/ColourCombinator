Our game, “Colour Combinator”, is a fun play on colour mixing and reaction time. In this 2-player game, players are given 3 buttons (in primary colours - red, blue and yellow) to hit. As coloured LEDs (in rainbow colours) appear on the interface, users have to smash the corresponding button (or combination of) ahead of their opponent in order to score a point. 


#### The game has 2 modes: 

##### 2 Player Leisure Play
Like its name, the leisure play mode is untimed. The game only progresses to the next level when a correct input is given. The scoring system remains the same as above. 

##### Rapid Fire
Unlike the leisure play mode, rapid fire increases game difficulty by imposing a time limit on each game question. If the player gives the correct input before the time limit for that round, he or she will be awarded points. The time limit for each question decreases (shorter answering period) as the game progresses.
